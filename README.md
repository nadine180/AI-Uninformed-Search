Uninformed Search Engine done using Java

How it works:   given a nxn grid with locations of stones, thanos and warriors. the search agent dubbed "Ironman" should navigate using different techniques, such as DFS and BFS and more. Encountering warriors and stones  and the snap action yield negative costs with different degrees. The path cost function tries to find the least cost possible and presents it as the correct path. the goal is to collect all stones and perform the snap action.
